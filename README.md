# CertiGuard - Secure Certificate Management on the Blockchain

CertiGuard is a Solidity smart contract designed to manage and verify certificates using the ERC-721 token standard. This contract provides a secure and decentralized solution for creating, verifying, and managing certificates on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, CertiGuard integrates the TFHE library for encryption, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive certificate information.

## Overview

CertiGuard addresses the need for a reliable and tamper-resistant method of managing certificates, such as academic credentials, professional certifications, and more. By utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and the ERC-721 standard, CertiGuard ensures the uniqueness and ownership of each certificate token, preventing unauthorized modifications.

The integration of the TFHE library for encryption allows sensitive certificate information to be stored securely while enabling authorized parties to access and verify certificates when necessary.

## Features

- **Certificate Creation**: Easily create new certificates by providing relevant information such as the name of the certificate holder.

- **Certificate Verification**: Certificates can be verified by authorized parties, providing transparency and trust in the authenticity of the certificates.

- **Encryption**: Sensitive information is encrypted using the TFHE library, ensuring privacy and security while enabling controlled access.

- **ERC-721 Standard**: CertiGuard implements the ERC-721 token standard, ensuring the uniqueness and ownership of each certificate token.

- **Event Emission**: The contract emits events for certificate creation and verification, facilitating transparency and real-time monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum Development Environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle)
- Solidity Compiler (0.8.13 to 0.9.0)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts and Libraries
- TFHE Library

### Installation

1. Clone the CertiGuard repository.
2. Install the required dependencies, including OpenZeppelin contracts and the TFHE library.
3. Compile the CertiGuard contract using a Solidity compiler compatible with the specified version range.
4. Deploy the contract on an Ethereum testnet or mainnet.

### Usage

Once deployed, the CertiGuard contract can be interacted with using Ethereum wallet software, DApp browsers, or custom user interfaces. The contract provides functions to create certificates, verify certificates, and retrieve encrypted keys.

Refer to the [Contract Details](#contract-details) section for information on available functions and their usage.

## Contract Details

### Certificate Structure

The contract utilizes the following structure to store certificate information:

```solidity
struct Certificate {
    uint256 id;
    string name;
    address owner;
    bool isVerified;
}
```

- `id`: Unique identifier for the certificate.
- `name`: Name associated with the certificate.
- `owner`: Ethereum address of the certificate owner.
- `isVerified`: Boolean indicating whether the certificate is verified.

### Events

CertiGuard emits the following events:

- `CertificateCreated(uint256 indexed id, string name, address indexed owner)`: Triggered when a new certificate is created.
- `CertificateVerified(uint256 indexed id)`: Triggered when a certificate is verified.

### Functions

The contract provides several functions for certificate management, verification, and key retrieval. Refer to the source code and function descriptions for more details.

## Security Considerations

When dealing with sensitive information and cryptographic operations, it's crucial to follow security best practices. Carefully review the codebase for vulnerabilities and engage security experts if needed.
